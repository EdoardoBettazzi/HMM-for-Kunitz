# HMM-for-Kunitz

This repository contains all the material for the development of an hidden Markov Model for detecting Kunitz/BPTI domains in protein sequences.

The material is organized as initial datasets, pipeline taking the datasets in input and returning the trained model with
its performance metrics used for optimisation. For anyone who finds it more convenient to run the pipeline remotely, a jupyter notebook is also present.

To dive in the discussion of the method, see HMM_kunitz.pdf
