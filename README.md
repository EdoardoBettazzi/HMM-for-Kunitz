# HMM-for-Kunitz

This repository contains all the material for the development of an hidden Markov Model for detecting Kunitz/BPTI domains in protein sequences.

The code can be found in the jupyter notebook, organized as a pipeline taking the initial datasets in input, and returning the trained model with the performance metrics used for optimization.

To dive in the discussion of the method, see HMM_kunitz.pdf
