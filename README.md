# HMM for Kunitz/BPTI domains

This repository contains all the material for the development of an hidden Markov Model for detecting Kunitz/BPTI domains in protein sequences.

The material is organized as initial datasets, pipeline taking the datasets in input and returning the trained model with its performance metrics used for optimisation.
To pipeline file contains all the instructions for running it: make sure that you collected the initial dataset files (requiring manual download), if you intend to run the pipeline automatically and not cell-by-cell.

To dive in the discussion of the method, see HMM_kunitz.pdf
